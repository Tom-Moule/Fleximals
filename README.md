# Fleximals
An OOP approach to converting numbers between bases 

## Fleximals overview

Within the scope of this project I am defining a fleximal as a number with a specified value within a specified base.

This project allows users to create these fleximals to convert numbers between bases and to compare numbers in different bases.



## Project description 

My initial motivation for this project was to find a way to convert a number between bases. As I was learning OOP in python at the time, I wanted to figure out how to use OOP principles to achieve this.

The key products of the project are:
- a Fleximal class, whose objects and methods are designed for converting between bases and comparing instances of the object
- a set of functions that enable a user journey in which users create, convert and compare fleximals


Through delivering this project I have learned:
- how to convert numbers into different bases
- how to use the principles of OOP effectively to build useful classes


## Usage instructions

Run main.py, and you will be led through a user journey in which youâ€™ll be asked to create, convert and compare fleximals


## File structure 

The repo contains 3 .py files:

- fleximal_object.py
- fleximal_functions.py
- main.py


fleximal_object.py contains the fleximal object
fleximal_functions.py contains three core functions used to acquire and validate numbers and bases from users, and to create the fleximal. 

main.py contains a function that defines the user journey, and runs that function.
